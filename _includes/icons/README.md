Icons used here are from a variety of sources.

- `email.svg`, `web.svg`, and `pdf.svg` come from
  [IcoMoon-Free](https://github.com/Keyamoon/IcoMoon-Free) and are used under
  the GNU GPLv3. I minified them and added some css classes.
- `github.svg` is modified from the one on the GitHub website.
- `instagram.svg` is modified from the Wikimedia commons version where it's
  claimed to be in the public domain.
- `linkedin.svg` logo is modified from
  [vectorico.com](http://www.vectorico.com/linkedin-icon-squircle/).
- `medium.svg` is modified from the official brand asset pack.
- `twitter.svg` is modified from the official brand asset pack.
