title: About
---

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Washington, but my other interests include:

- Sailing with the [Washington Yacht Club](http://www.washingtonyachtclub.org)
- Cooking and baking. You can find some of my best recipies on this site
- Sewing. I even worked as a tailor briefly in high school.

I strongly believe in open sourcing information and, to that end, I'm working on filling this site with all sorts of information I want to share.
