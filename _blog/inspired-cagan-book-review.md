A few months ago I was fortunate to get the opportunity to switch from my
software engineering role to a product management one at work. I hope that's the
right idea for myself and I'm thrilled about the prospect; however, I have no
product management training whatsoever. After some online research, it seemed
like _Inspired_ would be a good place to look for an introduction to the
discipline and it certainly delivers.

_Inspired_ is structured as an overview of the many components of product
management and Marty Cagan draws from his own experience in the role along with
the stories of other noteworthy product managers to exemplify the techniques and
processes he covers.

His experience---and his advice---is geared toward building tech products at
companies with a product-led approach.  For readers lucky enough to find
themselves in an environment near Cagan's ideal, I think the book would be an
excellent introduction to a product manager's day-to-day. For other readers, it
still effectively gets the product-thinking juices flowing. He gives
approachable advice for a new PM, but it's not clear how such a reader would go
about making the institutional changes he recommends should such a reader find
themselves in a less than optimal corporate structure.

The main focus of _Inspired_ is on product discovery, the process of identifying
customers and their needs and imagining a delightful, feasible product that can
be made to service them. Cagan especially emphasizes the importance of this
process to startups, where the product discovery process is critical to
achieving product-market fit. Readers are easily able to understand the
importance of close relationships with real customers, data driven decision
making and rapid iteration cycles.  _Inspired_ also describes some actionable
techniques for actually doing product discovery, chiefly the importance of
reference customers (customers whose needs you focus on and who give feedback
regularly) and the need to involve all internal stakeholders (design, marketing,
execs, engineering) in the discovery process.

I felt that _Inspired_ lived up to my expectations as a strong introduction to
the discipline but covered so much ground that I was occasionally left wanting
more detail. I'd recommend it to other aspiring product managers.

## Some of my takeaways

* Users won't switch to your product if it only has feature parity with their
  existing solution. They won't even switch if it's moderately better. It has to
  be _way better_.
* Product managers are expected to understand customer needs, business
  constraints, and engineering constraints, and find a solution that satisfies
  all of them.
* Users won't be able to tell you about the product they'd love. They'll be able
  to give you clues as to what they need, though.
* There are a few types of risk to product success: value risk is largest,
  although feasibility risk and business viability risk may also loom large.
* Product managers _must_ interface directly with customers to be most
  effective.
* Great products often come from doing something that's just now possible.
