title: Brown rice
tags: ["Rice", "Instant Pot"]
category: staple
time: 45 minutes
ingredients:
    - 2 cups brown rice
    - 8 cups water
    - About a teaspoon of salt
    - About a Tablespoon of oil
directions:
    - In a suitably sized pot, bring water to a boil.
    - Add the rice and reduce heat to medium.
    - Boil for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    - Strain the rice and return it to the pot, off the heat. Mix in the oil and
      salt.
    - Cover and let steam for 10 minutes, then fluff and serve.
notes:
    - I almost always use an Instant Pot to make brown rice, because it cuts the
      cooking time in half and it's a bit easier.
alternate:
    - method: Instant Pot
      open: true
      note: This method only uses a 1:1 ratio of water to rice (_i.e._ 2 cups
            water instead of 8).
      directions:
        - Add all ingredients to the Instant Pot.
        - Pressure cook on high for 22 minutes.
        - Let stand for 10 minutes after the timer, then release the pressure,
          fluff and serve.
