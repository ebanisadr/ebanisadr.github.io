Makes about half a crockpot (can be doubled). Easy, tasty, decent food. Very high bang for buck.

I imagine this can be done better on the stove with sauteed aromatics and better-timed additions of veggies but I haven't tried it.

Ends up slightly mushy when I leave it cooking while I'm at the office; I'll try starting from cold and update eventually.
