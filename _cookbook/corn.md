title: Corn
tags: ["Corn"]
category: staple
time: 15 minutes
ingredients:
    - Any number of ears of corn
    - Water
    - Salt
directions:
    - In a suitably sized pot, bring heavily salted water and salt to a boil.
      (Use about 4 Tablespoons salt for a 4 quart pot.) Ensure that there is
      enough space so the pot won't overflow when the corn is added.
    - Once boiling, add the corn.
    - Boil for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    - When the corn is slightly soft, remove from the pot and serve.
notes:
    - I have not experimented with butter on corn because I'm allergic to it.
    - If the corn is not very sweet, add 1-2 Tbsp sugar with the salt.
